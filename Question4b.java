/*
 * Algorithm Explanation:
 * 
 * In this problem, we want to determine the minimum number of roads that must be traversed 
 * to collect all packages and return to the starting location. Each location in the city is 
 * represented as a node in a graph, and roads between locations are the edges.
 *
 * Key Points:
 * 1. Each node may have a package (denoted by 1) or not (denoted by 0).
 * 2. From any starting node, you can collect packages from all nodes that are within a distance 
 *    of 2 (using BFS to compute distances).
 * 3. You can move to an adjacent node, and if needed, collect additional packages from that new 
 *    position (again within a distance of 2).
 * 4. The goal is to compute the minimum number of roads traversed such that all packages are 
 *    collected and you return to your starting location.
 *
 * Approach:
 * - Construct the graph using an adjacency list.
 * - For each possible starting node, use BFS to determine nodes reachable within a distance of 2 
 *   and collect packages.
 * - If some packages remain uncollected, simulate a move to each adjacent node, update the collection 
 *   using BFS from the new node, and calculate the total roads used (including the return trip).
 * - The answer is the minimum roads traversed over all starting nodes. If itâ€™s impossible to collect 
 *   all packages, return -1.
 *
 * Note: This code assumes that traversing a road multiple times is counted separately each time.

/*
 * Test Results:
 * -------------
 * Test Case 1:
 * Input: packages = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], roads = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3,
 * 4], [4, 5]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * - Starting at an optimal node, the algorithm collects the package at location
 * 0 and location 5
 * within a distance of 2. The calculated minimum number of roads to traverse
 * and return to the
 * starting point is 2.
 * 
 * Test Case 2:
 * Input: packages = [0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], roads =
 * [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[5,6],[5,7]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * - With an optimal starting point, the algorithm collects packages at
 * locations 3, 4, and 7 by
 * moving to an adjacent node and using BFS to collect packages within a
 * distance of 2, then
 * returning to the starting location. The minimum number of roads traversed is
 * 2.
